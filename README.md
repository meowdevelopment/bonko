# bonko

A set of utilities for bongo.cat

Simply copy the script in [main.js](https://github.com/itzTheMeow/bonko/blob/master/main.js) and run it in the [bongo.cat](https://bongo.cat) console.
You _could_ compile the modules into the script yourself and run that, but we dont to make it smaller and save time.
